# Text Classification through Features
The project consists of three programs and experiments which are as follows:
Experiment 1: Text Classification based on Natural Language Processing based extracted feature vectors combined with Deep Learning
Experiment 2: Text Classification based on Embedding of only the extracted features combined with Deep Learning
Experiment 3: Text Classification based on Embedding of feature and original text combined with Deep Learning
For Experiments 2 and 3, the pre-trained glove embedding would be required which can be found at:http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.840B.300d.zip. 
Dataset: HASOC 2019 (English).
