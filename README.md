# IR_Project
Text Classification through Features
The project consists of three programs and experiments which are as follows:
Experiment 1: Text Classification based on Natural Language Processing based extracted feature vectors combined with Deep Learning
Experiment 2: Text Classification based on Embedding of only the extracted features combined with Deep Learning
Experiment 3: Text Classification based on Embedding of feature and original text combined with Deep Learning
For Experiment 1, the datasets given aside are required. Rest other dependencies have already been installed via the code file itself.
It would be advisable to run them via a platform like colab.
For Experiments 2 and 3, the pre-trained glove embedding would be required which can be found at:http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.840B.300d.zip. The file could not be loaded due to its huge size.
Dataset: HASOC 2019 (English).
